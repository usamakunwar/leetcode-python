Your goal is to find the <b>minimal</b> distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most <b>one nut</b> at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.\n",
